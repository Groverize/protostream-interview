# Protostream Interview
Completed Sunday between 7:30AM and 9:30AM (with a short unexpected break for breakfast). Total time was a little over 1hr 30mins.

## Errors:
Missing images in one of the object. Used a temporary placeholder but would likely just omit that video untill i've discussed with the client how to handle these types of issues.

I forgot to keep committing often after breakfast so sorry about the lack of commits between 8:00-9:30. Generally, I'd commit each feature separately or if fixing issues, each issue would have it's own commit with an issue reference of some sort (ticket number/description. Depends on system).

Added the pointer cursor late because it bothered me when i looked at it again.

## Notes
I've used a pretty hacky way of getting screen size using the Angular CDK directly in a component. I would usually do this on a more global level but i was short on time and wanted to implement the responsive part roughly.

The stucture is based on the idea that there might be more features than just video. With a complete spec and a bit more time, I might choose a different structure (pages/components rather than features) but it usually depends on the size of the project.

The "Order By Release Date" switches between directions depending on the current direction.

I tried to do this with minimal googling but i wasted some time because i forgot that you can't directly compare dates in TypeScript like you can in JavaScript.

Thank you for your time.
